For an introduction to the text, please visit [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Cryptanalytics).  Sadly, [Aegean Park Press] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Park_Press) is unresponsive but Military Cryptanalytics is available as a PDF from the [NSA] (https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/military_cryptanalysis.shtml).
