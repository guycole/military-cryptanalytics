For an introduction to the text, please visit [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Cryptanalytics).  Sadly, Aegean Park Press [Wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Park_Press) is unresponsive but the Military Cryptanalytics is available for download from the [NSA] (https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/declass/military_cryptanalysis.shtml).
